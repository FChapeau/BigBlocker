#Big Blocker

A data collection Minecraft mod, coupled with a data analytics system.

##The project

Starting a new job in a data-enhanced marketing firm, I want to practice crunching data to gather meaningful information about Minecraft gameplay, such as mining efficiency stats and the like. The mod itself is only a probe and would feed it's data into an external service which would do the actual processing, as well as exposing an API and web interface for easy data consultation. 

##Wishlist

I want the mod to collect as much data as possible and make it relevant later through on-demand analysis. I want said data collection to have as little an impact on gameplay as possible. I would like it to work with any mods you might have installed, and maybe integrate with some (such as Applied Energistics or Buildcraft.)  I also want the mod to work in a local single-player as well as on a multiplayer dedicated server.
